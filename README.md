GhanaLoanConnect is a Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI) that facilitates peer-to-peer lending. By connecting individuals who need financial support (borrowers) with those who have excess funds and are willing to invest (lenders), the platform plays a crucial role in the financial ecosystem. However, like many lending institutions, GhanaLoanConnect faces the challenge of nonperforming loans (NPLs) — loans where the borrower defaults or fails to make timely repayment
Non-performing loans(NPLs) pose a significant challenge to Ghana’s banking sector, with the NPL ratio rising to 22.7% as of October 2024, up from 18.3% a year earlier. This surge threatens financial stability, as high NPL levels can erode bank profitability and limit credit availability. GhanaLoanConnect aims to address this issue by developing a predictive model to identify potential loan defaults, enabling proactive risk management and lending decisions
